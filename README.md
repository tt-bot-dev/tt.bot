tt.bot is a simple to use moderation/utility bot written in JavaScript using [Node.js] and the [Sosamba] framework based on the [Eris] library.

# Features
- **Emoji to picture**: A simple way to convert your magnificent emoji to an animated PNG image!
> *Rendering APNGs is not currently supported by Discord, thereby, the preview will display as a still image.*
- **Extensions**: Is tt.bot's command suite not enough for you? Build your own commands using a powerful JavaScript API.
- **Free software**: tt.bot is free software distributed under the [GNU AGPL v3 or later](./LICENSE). Translations for tt.bot are licensed under the [MIT License][language-license].
- **Cross-server telephony**: Chat with anyone using tt.bot across Discord.
> *Setup is required in order to use tt.bot's telephony features.*
- **Customizability**: Most of tt.bot's behavior is opt-out by default, allowing you to enable only the features you truly want. You can even make tt.bot speak a different language or let tt.bot display time in your timezone!
- **Moderation**: tt.bot features a simple to use moderation suite in order to help server moderators keep their server clean.
- **Welcome/leave messages**: Say hello/goodbye to your members with your own custom message.
- **Logging:** Log certain events on your server with simple and clean output.
