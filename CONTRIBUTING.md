# Contributing to tt.bot
Thank you for your interest in contributing to tt.bot. We have some rules set in order to keep the code as clean as possible. Some of these rules are enforced automatically using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Code style
We use ESLint along with [our own configuration](https://github.com/tt-bot-dev/eslint-config) to format the code. To lint the code, run `npx eslint .`.

## Adding/modifying features

When adding a new feature, please check whether the feature you'd like to work on isn't already worked on. If it isn't worked on, it is recommended to consult the feature with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pGN5dMq).
